      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>High school and college studies focused on music and science, particularly music performance like choir and classical guitar and physics and astronomy for my science focus. Photography was a favorite elective. More recently I completed a course in Nutritional Therapy, and pursued general aviation as well by getting my Private Pilots license and Instrument rating.</p>

      <h2>Current interests/hobbies/skills</h2>
      <p><strong>I love being a mom</strong>! My daughter Kessa is 2 - going on 3 - and although it sounds cliche, being her mommy is the most <span class="important">challenging</span> and <span class="important">rewarding</span> chapter in my life thus far. I also love aviation, technology, scuba diving, exploring the world, yoga, nutrition, music, and hanging out with my close friends and family.
