      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>High school and college studies focused on music and science, particularly music performance like choir and classical guitar and physics and astronomy for my science focus. Photography was a favorite elective. More recently I completed a course in Nutritional Therapy, and pursued general aviation as well by getting my Private Pilots license and Instrument rating.</p>

      <h2>Job Experience</h2>
      <p>Nearly 20 years of experience with customer service in the hospitality industry. Currently employed as a Senior Customer Service Jedi and Manager for Coradine Aviation where I remotely manage a small team of 6 CS reps who provide tech support via email using Tender. Since this job includes support for various customizable reports all written with CSS and HTML, I decided to embark on my programming eduction by joining the part-time Intro to Programming evening class at Epicodus.</p>

      <h2>Current interests/hobbies/skills</h2>
      <p>I love being a mom! My daughter Kessa is 2 1/2 and although it sounds cliche, being her mommy is the most challenging and rewarding chapter in my life thus far. I also love aviation, technology, scuba diving, exploring the world, yoga, nutrition, music, and hanging out with my close friends and family.</p>
